Emotion Detector

Overview
Emotion Detector is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to analyze and detect emotions from textual input. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify text into different emotional categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting text and receiving emotion predictions.

Features
Text Input: Users can input text via a user-friendly interface or directly through an API.
Emotion Prediction: The system predicts the dominant emotion(s) present in the input text.
Multi-Class Classification: Supports classification into multiple emotion categories simultaneously.
Customizable: Users can fine-tune the model or train it on custom datasets for specific use cases.
Scalable: Designed to handle large volumes of text data efficiently.
API Access: Provides an API for integrating emotion detection into other applications or services.
